        <h1>Research</h1>

I am currently co-supervising two Ph.D. students: Lana Scravaglieri and Asia Auville.

<h3>Ongoing projects</h3>

<ul>

<li>
<b>Learning LLVM IR with GNN/embedding/ML for full stack optimization. </b>
In 2021, I initiated a code characterization and optimization initiative based on the LLVM Intermediate Representation. 
The key idea is to embed the code intermediate representation from the compiler into a vector and use it to guide the different optimization parameters. 
The method achieves the same performance gains as state-of-the-art offline tuning strategies while using 3x less resources. 
Through Lana Scravaglieri Ph.D. thesis, we further increase the performance and energy savings by expanding the optimization spaces with vectorization and floating point accuracy tradeoffs.

<li>  <b>MPI code verification and correction with ML/LLMs.</b> In 2023, we started an MPI program verification initiative. 
MPI programming is necessary to use large-scale clusters but it can be difficult and error prone. 
Thus, the key idea of our research is to utilize embedding and deep-learning graph neural networks (GNNs) to identify bugs in MPI programs. 
This eases the development of large-scale applications. Specifically, we designed and developed two models that determine, from a code’s compiler representation, whether the code is correct or contains a known MPI error. 
We tested our models using two dedicated MPI benchmark suites for verification: MBI and MPI-CorrBench and achieved results on par with the costly state-of-the-art verification tools.  
This work pioneered the usage of ML-based strategies for HPC verification. 
We are currently evaluating the potential for IA/LLM program fix approaches with Asia Auville Ph.D. thesis.

<li>
<b>I/O classification. </b> 
In 2024, I started contributing to the characterization of the I/O behavior of HPC applications. 
Informing the system about I/O is valuable for I/O scheduling or burst buffer optimization. 
We investigate I/O traces from several clusters and look at features to group similar I/O job activities: our goal is to define a taxonomy (a la Berkeley’s Dwarves) of I/O patterns over HPC systems to help practitioners and users.

<h3>Software tool</h3>
<p> My phd was focused on parallel programs decomposition. 
Most of its ideas  are included in the open source framework <a href="https://benchmark-subsetting.github.io/cere/"> <b> CERE</b></a>.

<p> In 2024 in the context of Lana Scravaglieri Ph.D. thesis, I started working on a framework to set up compiler, runtime, and hardware parameters, efficiently and flexibly. The tool will be available soon.
